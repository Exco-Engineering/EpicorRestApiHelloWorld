# EpicorRestApiHelloWorld
Reference project showing how to use Epicor's REST API

## API key and user name
This project requires the epicor credentials to be passed in as enviroment variables, we want to keep these out of the repo and user's computers.
Ideally, only your server holds these, and the clients just ask the server for data.
